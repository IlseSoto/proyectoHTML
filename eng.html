					<th id="pinta"><b>Plot: </b></th><td>A young girl is suddenly awoken by a strange man who refers to himself simply as RGB. He is formal in speech and odd in the head, or in the television set where his head should be. He asks her if she would like to become a hero, and though she answers with gusto, she doesn't have any knowledge of what will be expected of her as she leaves her home for a world in the skies.
					The journey across the clouds takes her to a world badly in need of a hero, where lies and fears are very real and very dangerous. The hero's courage helps her survive her first encounter with fear itself, but her very young age — and RGB's refusal to explain anything — make it a difficult and dangerous journey for her.</td>

It soon turns out that the town is haunted by ghosts and other supernatural creatures, which only a handful of people, Max included, can see. The comic derives a lot of humor from ludicrous wordplay, self-deprecation, and its parodying of common Anime tropes.
					After a hectic first day of school, Max finds himself joining the (Paranatural) Activity Club, whose purpose is to keep paranormal activity around the school in check, and to help young spectrals like Max understand and control their powers. Mostly they just mess around though.</td>
